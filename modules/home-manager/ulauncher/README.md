# Ulauncher Module
This module configures Ulauncher. Ulauncher does not have any home manager support, so I intend to build my own, assuming I decide to keep using it.

> Rofi cannot do live updates while I am typing (such as showing conversions to several currencies for the number I am typing). This is something I have come to need in a launcher after using KDE's krunner for a while.
